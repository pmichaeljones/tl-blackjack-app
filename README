How do you submit an HTTP POST request, with a "username" attribute set to "bob"? What if we wanted a GET request instead?
post '/' {session[:username] = params[:name]}
-You wouldn't use a GET request because you're affecting data which is what POST methods are for.


Why is it important for us, as web developers, to understand that HTTP is a "stateless" protocol?
- We need to continually re-render the environment for the end-user because nothing is persistent. We need to create the state for every single request.


If the internet is just HTTP requests/responses, why do we only use browsers to interface with web applications? Are there any other options?
- I honestly don't know. I'm sure you could use command line, but that'd be boring. Browsers make interaction enjoyable. I believe any RESTful interface would work for this.


What is MVC, and why is it important?
- It's the separation of a web app into 3 areas. The database(model), the view(templates) and the controller(the actions area)

The below questions are about Sinatra:


At a high level, how are requests processed?
- A method is taken on a certain route and a block of code is executed


In the controller/action, what's the difference between rendering and redirecting?
- Rendering displays a template while redirecting sends you to another request action

In the ERB view template, how do you show dynamic content?
- You could set an instance variable to display the new content if the variable existed.


Given what you know about ERB templates, when do you suppose the ERB template is turned into HTML?
- After Ruby code is executed, the ERB template gets turned into HTML and sent back to the client-side


What's the role of instance variables in Sinatra?
- Used for adjusting presentation of content based on state application
